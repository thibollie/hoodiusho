There is now a Threat Thursday Subreddit r/FEHThreatThursday if you want to make sure you don’t miss a post be sure to subscribe there! (I can also tag you in these threads if you want as well just let me know!) --- Welcome to Threat Thursday in this Threat Thursday is a thread where we post counters and discuss these counters to a specific threat each week. This week we’ll be dealing with Eternal Youth, Nowi Next week I will post some of the best optimal, budget and creative counters. #Why's this post being made? Recently CH has seen more activity, which is great! However, a lot of the posts we're seeing are pretty negative in nature. This goes against the original CH aim of being a welcoming, relaxed and positive place for Smashers to get better together. While most of the OPs have been civil in the discussion following their original post, I just wanted to address this before it becomes the norm. A couple trends I'm noticing are: - Focusing on FG win rates - A feeli. Blackrock Mountain: 1/10 I would have to rate this the worst trailer, unless you like really enjoy the art on Demonwrath. There is no catchy song and the animations are all just fiery. Please remake this trailer blizzerd with ragnaros singing a catchy tune Goblins vs Gnomes: 3/10 Catchy tune but this little diddy isn't making me diddle my fiddle. I'd riddle 3/10 bc of the cute tune but boring and very short trailer otherwise. The Grand Tournament: Hey everyone, sorry for the delay, I haven't been able to make time to sit down and get this all written up. We had 15 vendors participate in the New Years /r/all giveaway (https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/5laqtd/lets_get_this_on_rall_for_the_4th_time_quitting/) where I said there would be 10 winners per vendor participating. I don't know what each vendor will be giving out as some are eliquid and some are hardware, so winners prizes/shipping are determined by their respe. Throughout last year I was putting together round ups of recent releases but at the end of last year I had some laptop troubles and have been really busy so I've had to put the articles on hold. Writing my best of 2015 article ( took a lot longer than expected too as well. I haven't been able to give reviews of each release like I usually do because I've been a bit busy but I will be back to that format in the future. originally had this as a comment here ( but a few people told me to make a separate post, so here you go. DISCLAIMER: I don't know if all of these are confirmed for this year. Some of them are rumors and some of them have been delayed a lot and might not come out this year, like the Big K.R.I.T amp Yelawolf collab album. 2 Chainz – B.O.A.T.S III 50 Cent - Animal Ambition EDIT:I'LL MAKE A NEW UPDATED POST TOMORROW If I missed any post it.
